mutt-ical.py is meant as a simple way to reply to ical invitations from mutt.

To use it, copy it and ical_reply_sendmail_wrapper.sh to some directory in your $PATH.

In order to be able to use it from mutt, modify your ~/.mailcap or /etc/mailcap
files to call this script, add lines like:

    text/calendar; mutt-ical.py -i -e "your@email.address" %s
    application/ics; mutt-ical.py -i -e "your@email.address" %s

(Don't forget to add your email address)

To reply, just open the ical file from mutt.
